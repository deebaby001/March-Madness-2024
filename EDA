Predictions
I will will performing research to find:
1. Evaulate the variables that may effect the outcome to wins vs losses:
(a.) Field Goals (made by winning teams and losing teams)
(b.) 3-Pointers (made by winning teams and losing teams)
(c.) Turnovers (by winning team and losing teams)
(d.) Personal Fouls (by winning and losing teams)

NOTE: The data available is not by individual player, it is by group (team).These are group predictions, not individual player predictions, they are by group (team)

I am predicting that the higher the number of variables and the scores, the higher the probability of the winning team to win the entire championship.
Yet, the higher the probability of Personal Fouls and Turnovers, the higher the probability that you will not win the entire championship.

1. The probability of winning the March Madness Competition sponsored by Kaggle
2. The use of XG Boosting and creating a log-loss model (Bracket) to use in the 2024 NCAA season that will be a winning prediction.
